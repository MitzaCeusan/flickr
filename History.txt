== 1.0.3 2008-04-18

* Various bugfixes:
	* User instantiation was broken (wrong number of params passed)
	* Instantiating photos failed in several places if single photo returned
	* Photosets#getInfo would always fail as the parameter name should be photoset_id, not photosets_id
	* Removed call to flickr.people.getOnlineList in Flickr#users as that call is no longer in the Flickr API
* Performance improvements:
	* Url and image source uri now generated without a call to the Flickr API, as per the Flickr API docs
